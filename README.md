## How to run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. In the terminal navigate to the root folder of the app and run `npm install`
3. After the modules are all installed, run the app using `npm start`

## Some things I'd like to work on:

1. Utilize React Router to make multiple pages focusing on the details of the business
2. Make better animation
3. Integrated map
4. Include reviews

### Happy coding!!
